## Overview

This is a Disease Prediction App built using python react and flask.It helps to predict diseases of 42 types to a user giving 132 symptoms to the model.

## Tech Stack:
1.Python (for backing and making te model)     
2.Flask (for model deployment)    
2.React Js (for client interface)    
4.Scikit - Learn (for model designing)  
5.Pandas (for feature engineering)  

## Installation Guide:

- First git clone the project using command ` git clone https://github.com/jgyfutub/DiseasePredictionApp.git `
- Then open the cloned folder on Visual Studio Code
- Split the terminal so that each terminal can work for backend and frontend

#### For Reactjs:

- open terminal in VS code and go into imagegenerator folder if you are not there
- write ` cd front ` to enter frontend files
- write ` npm i ` for all frontend modules to be downloaded
- write ` npm start ` to start the frontend server
- go to http://localhost:3000/ to use app

#### For FLask

- Open Command prompt of your system
- ensure that virtual enviroment and python is installed in system
- write ` python -m venv venv ` to enter a virtual enviroment
- write ` venv\Scripts\activate ` to activate it
- now cd to pybackend to access flask file
- install dependencies ` pip install flask joblib flask_cors scikit-learn==1.2.2 `
- now write ` python flaskmain.py ` to start server
